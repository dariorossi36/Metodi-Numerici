In this repository there are programs for a Master exam called "Metodi numerici per la Fisica", (Numerical methods for Physics). It is composed of 3 parts: the first one deals with 
the Ising Model 2D, where we analyzed behaviour of the system around the phase transition temperature; the second one uses path integral to study a simple harmonic oscillator 1D; the third one
is about a quantum scalar field always viewed through a path integral approach. Every Numerical analysis is based on Monte-Carlo Markov chain algorithms: for the first two parts we used 
Metropolis algorithm, while for the latter a Heathbath together with an Over-relaxation.
